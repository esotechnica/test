# What is mathematics?

```{div} start-para
On the definition of the term *mathematics*, there seems to be no universal agreement. This is partly because the depth and scope of mathematics has expanded over the centuries, especially with the insights into its foundations during the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. It is not simply about numbers and measurement, geometry and space, algebra and calculus. These are some examples of *fields* of mathematics, applications of mathematical enquiry to address a particular problem domain. In any case, there is little to be gained from trying to give this word a definition. Rather, an understanding of the nature of mathematics would be more illuminating. This article attempts to provide such an insight, by showing why mathematics is such a unique discipline, how logic underpins its foundations, and how it may provide answers to the deepest questions in science and philosophy.

In ancient times, mathematics was a useful tool for creating abstract models of the properties of, and relationships between, objects observed in the real world. The earliest example of this was the concept of *quantity*. Prehistoric humans recognised a certain property shared between, say, the fingers on one hand, the toes on one foot, and the petals of a geranium. Numbers were invented for communicating this concept, with the number ‘five’ being used to identify the shared property in the aforementioned scenario. Arithmetic followed, out of the necessity for calculation in matters of trade and taxation. The advent of the Babylonian sexagesimal (base 60) number system was the first positional number system, greatly simplifying and speeding up the process of calculation. Primitive forms of algebra and geometry arose in response to the increase in societal and technological complexity, especially in the disciplines of navigation, engineering and astronomy.

The development of ancient mathematics was driven by the desire to efficiently find solutions to everyday practical problems. Whether it was calculating the amount of change you should receive from a purchase, or building the Pyramids, mathematics was firmly grounded in the real world. But prior to the mathematics of the Greeks, early mathematics did not resemble the rigorous nature of the mathematics of today. These discoveries were more like mathematical ‘rules of thumb’; recipes that seemed to work effectively, because they produced correct answers time and time again, without fail. A deeper understanding of why they worked was less important. In this sense, pre-Greek mathematics was primarily based on *inductive reasoning*. Observing that the formula for calculating the area of a circle worked effectively in every case seen so far, the formula was accepted as universally valid. That is, it will work for any circle that may ever be conceived, now and forever, anywhere in the world.

Inductive reasoning is the basis of modern science. It relies on observation of phenomena to support a particular hypothesis. Europeans up until the end of the <sup>17th</sup> century had come to the conclusion, via inductive reasoning, that all swans were white. This was not an unreasonable conclusion to make. All swans observed thus far by Europeans, since the beginning of history, were white. But the fragility of inductive reasoning is that one counterexample will bring the entire hypothesis crashing down instantly. This is, of course, what happened with the ‘white swan’ theory, when black swans were discovered in Australia. At best, inductive reasoning is a level of confidence, a probability, but never a certainty.

But what if you could develop a system of reasoning that ensured you could reach an unassailable conclusion? One in which you could prove a hypothesis (known in mathematics as a conjecture) to be true? And it would forever be true, and had always been true? And it would not be possible ever to disprove it? Such a system, known as *deductive reasoning*, was developed over time by the ancient Greeks. A system of deductive reasoning is defined by its *rules of inference*. In essence, a rule of inference generates a new truth from previously established truths. The previously established truths form the *premises* of the rule, and the newly generated truth is known as the *conclusion*.
